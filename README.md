# Synthesis project

An automated assignment algorithm that matches customers with translators based on language, industry, manufacturer, subindustry, task type and budget.

## The problems
iDISC, a localization company, needed a better way to manage their customer-translator matching process. In localization, choosing the right translator isn't just about language, industry expertise and dialect matter just as much.

## The solution
A user-friendly web application that automates the matching process while considering all relevant variables. The interface was designed with simplicity in mind to make the system accessible to non-technical users.

## Repository info 
This repo contains solely the front-end implementation. The back-end remains private.

## Showcase

## Tech Stack
The project was developed using the ReactJS framework, as well as the NextJS framework on top of it. This allowed us to work on a beautiful interconnected single page application, and thus avoiding some of the problems that araise from routing and nesting pages.

The project is very divided in components and the code is fully commented. This is so to ensure the maintainability of itself and to make it easier for other fellow developers to have a grasp of how it works.

## Setup 
```

`
npm install 
npm run dev 
`

Now open http://localhost:3000 and see it for yourself.
